## 🔎 Data Processing & Analysis  
The data was processed using:
- **Google Sheets** for initial cleaning:
  - Removing duplicates
  - Handling missing values
  - Filtering relevant columns
- **MySQL** for efficient data transformation:
  - Merging multiple tables
  - Calculating user engagement levels
- **Tableau** for data visualization:
  - Identifying trends in physical activity, sleep, and heart rate  
  - Correlation analysis between activity and calorie expenditure

## 📈 Key Findings  
- **Activity & Calorie Trends:** Users burned the most calories on Saturdays and the least on Sundays.  
- **Sleep Patterns:** Users slept the most on Sundays and the least on Fridays, likely influenced by work schedules.  
- **Heart Rate Insights:** The lowest heart rate was recorded at **4 AM**, while peak levels occurred at **4 PM and 6 PM**.  
- **User Behavior:** Only **2 out of 3 users** tracked their sleep, and many failed to meet recommended sleep hours (7 hours per night).

## 📊 Marketing Recommendations  
1. **Personalized Activity Insights:** Bellabeat can encourage users to engage in more physical activity during less active periods.  
2. **Sleep Monitoring Enhancements:** Offering **sleep-tracking features** (e.g., sleep sounds, light pollution analysis) could improve user engagement.  
3. **Heart Rate-Based Recommendations:** The app could suggest **relaxation techniques** when irregular heart rate patterns are detected.  
4. **Subscription Model Improvements:** Rewarding users for **consistent fitness tracking** could increase subscriptions.
